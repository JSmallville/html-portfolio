<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>With a strong foundation in Customer Experience (CX) and Support Operations gained from a dynamic career in the Fintech sector, I am now embarking on a new journey in web development</p>

<p>During my tenure as a CX and CS Operations Team Lead at ViaBill, I not only led and coached a team of 6 agents but also spearheaded customer support projects that had a company-wide impact. My hands-on approach and leadership increased our TrustPilot score from 3.9 to an impressive 4.6, reflecting my commitment to enhancing customer satisfaction. Additionally, I reduced customer ticket volumes by 35% through the implementation of chat flows and help desks, showcasing my ability to drive operational efficiency.</p>

<p>My passion for continuous learning is evident through my certifications in CX Academy, Dixa Admin (CRM), Jira, and CS/CSM courses. As a dedicated professional with a strong interest in personal and professional growth, I am eager to apply my skills and enthusiasm to the world of web development, embarking on a new and exciting chapter in my career.</p>
